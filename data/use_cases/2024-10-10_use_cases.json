Their essential needs are for: shelter, hydration, food, warmth, light, hygiene, health, safety from hazards, news about the crisis, help from others, earn a living, contact loved ones, volunteer/help others, entertainment, get home from work and/or pick up children from school/childcare. \n                    There are four steps involved in providing this guidance: STEP 1: Identify the barriers that the crisis will cause for the public meeting each of the essential needs (e.g. a flood could cause a power outage that means people can't use their phones to check in on elderly/vulnerable relatives) STEP 2: Identify what actions the public might take to meet their needs, despite the crisis (e.g. someone might leave their home to visit a nearby family member or friend to use their phone to contact their relative) STEP 3: Identify what positive or negative consequences could arise as a result of the actions people may take to meet their needs (e.g. a person leaving their home during a flood could get swept away) STEP 4: Develop communications and messages to help remove the barriers and protect people from experiencing the harms identified (e.g. tell people not to leave their home as the flood waters could put them at risk of injury or death and issue messaging that lets people know that anyone on the Priority Services Register will be visited by a member of their local resilience team to check on them - and therefore that family members should not leave their homes to do this themselves). Please provide output for each step for each essential need, ensuring that messages are specific (e.g. they don't just tell people what not to do, they say what they should do instead). \n                    In tactics section: provide a quick reference handbook of key comms actions pre-crisis, over the first hour, day and week, key other departments to contact, draft holding line and messages in the Krebs format (outlining what is known, what is not known, what the public should do, what government is doing, and when more information will be made available).
